# Text-to-Speech Converter

Welcome to the **Text-to-Speech Converter**! This repository contains a web-based application that converts user-provided text into clear, natural-sounding speech using the browser's built-in Speech Synthesis API.

## üìù Test Speech Script

> **Hello and welcome to our Text-to-Speech Converter demo.**  
> This application seamlessly transforms any written text into clear, natural-sounding speech. You can choose from multiple voices grouped by language, adjust speaking rate and pitch to suit your style, and instantly preview each voice before converting. Let‚Äôs give it a try‚Äîtype any sentence you like, hit ‚ÄúSpeak,‚Äù and hear your words come to life!

## üí° Project Description

The **Text-to-Speech Converter** is a modern, interactive web tool that allows users to:

- Select from multiple voices (grouped by language) provided by the browser/OS.
- Preview each voice on hover to hear a sample before committing.
- Adjust **rate** (speed) and **pitch** of the synthesized voice in real time.
- Convert any text input into spoken audio with a single click.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3** for semantic markup and responsive styling.  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for DOM manipulation, event handling, and app logic.  
- **Web Speech API** (`speechSynthesis`, `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`) for client-side text-to-speech functionality.  
- **Particles.js** for an interactive, animated background effect.  
- **OS/Browser Native Voices** leveraged from the host system for multi-language support.  
- **Keyframe Animations** for engaging UI effects like zoom-in, fade-in, and bounce.
